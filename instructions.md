## How to Run Locally

To run the JSON Comparator locally, you can use Python's built-in HTTP server. This ensures that all scripts and resources load correctly.

1. **Open Terminal**
   Open your terminal application.

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**
   Change to the directory where the files are located:
   ```bash
   cd /home/anuj/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/json_comparator
   ```

3. **Start the Server**
   Run the following command to start a simple HTTP server on port 8080:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   ```

4. **Access the Tool**
   Open your web browser and visit:
   [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
